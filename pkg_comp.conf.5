.Dt PKG_COMP.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_comp.conf
.Nd configuration file format for the pkg_comp tool
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Configuration files for
.Xr pkg_comp 8
are plain shell scripts that define a set of recognized variables and can
optionally fill in a set of hooks provided as shell functions.
.Ss Configuration variables
As scripts, configuration files can perform any magic they desire to deduce
the value of configuration variables.
.Pp
The following variables configure general settings:
.Bl -tag -width SANDBOX_CONFFILE
.It Va AUTO_PACKAGES
Whitespace-separated list of package names that will be automatically built
by the
.Sq auto
command unless package names are provided on the command line.
This is akin to pbulk's
.Dq limited list
file contents, specifying the subset of packages that are interesting for
this automated build.
.Pp
The packages to build can be provided either as bare names, such as
.Sq tmux ,
or as category/package pairs, such as
.Sq misc/tmux .
.It Va SANDBOX_CONFFILE
Absolute path to a file in the host that contains the
.Xr sandboxctl 8
configuration to use for the build of packages.
.Pp
The contents of this file are slightly different than what
.Xr sandboxctl 8
accepts.
In particular, if you want to define
.Xr sandboxctl 8 Ns 's
own
.Fn post_create_hook
and
.Fn post_mount_hook
hooks, you must define
.Fn pkg_comp_post_create_hook
and
.Fn pkg_comp_post_mount_hook
instead.
Any changes to the former two will be discarded.
.Pp
Default: not defined.
.El
.Pp
The following variables configure how to fetch pkgsrc from a version control
system:
.Bl -tag -width SANDBOX_CONFFILE
.It Va CVS_ROOT
Location of the CVS root from which to check out or update the pkgsrc
module.
.Pp
This variable is only used if
.Va FETCH_VCS
is set to
.Sq cvs .
.Pp
Default:
.Sq :ext:anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot .
.It Va CVS_TAG
CVS tag to use during checkouts or updates of the pkgsrc module.
.Pp
This variable is only used if
.Va FETCH_VCS
is set to
.Sq cvs .
.Pp
Default: not defined.
.It Va FETCH_VCS
Determines the version control system to use to fetch the pkgsrc tree.
Can be one of
.Sq cvs
or
.Sq git .
The requested tool must be installed on the system.
.Pp
Default:
.Sq cvs .
.It Va GIT_BRANCH
Git branch to use during clones or updates of the pkgsrc working copy.
.Pp
This variable is only used if
.Va FETCH_VCS
is set to
.Sq git .
.Pp
Default:
.Sq trunk .
.It Va GIT_URL
Git remote URL specification to use during clones or updates of the pkgsrc
working copy.
.Pp
This variable is only used if
.Va FETCH_VCS
is set to
.Sq git .
.Pp
Default:
.Sq https://github.com/NetBSD/pkgsrc.git .
.El
.Pp
The following variables configure the pkgsrc environment on the host (i.e
.Em Ns . outside
of the sandbox):
.Bl -tag -width SANDBOX_CONFFILE
.It Va DISTDIR
Absolute path to the directory in the host that holds the distribution
files for pkgsrc (i.e. all the source files downloaded during the build of
packages).
.Pp
This directory is mounted read-write within the sandbox to allow reuse of
the immutable distribution files across rebuilds of the sandbox.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles .
.It Va PACKAGES
Absolute path to the directory in the host that will hold the built binary
packages and bootstrap kit for the target environment.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc/packages .
.It Va PBULK_PACKAGES
Absolute path to the directory in the host that will hold the built binary
packages and bootstrap kit for the pbulk installation in the sandbox.
.Pp
It does not make much sense to use these files outside of the sandbox because
they are hardcoded to match the internal needs of
.Xr pkg_comp 8
(e.g. the paths used in these binary packages are not customizable).
However,
.Xr pkg_comp 8
will reuse these files on subsequent rebuilds of the sandbox for speed, so you
may want to keep them around.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc/packages/pbulk .
.It Va PKGSRCDIR
Absolute path to the directory in the host that contains or will contain the
pkgsrc tree.
.Pp
If you want
.Xr pkg_comp 8
to perform an update of this directory before every build, you will need
write access to it.
Otherwise, you can use a read-only directory.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.It Va UPDATE_SOURCES
Whether to perform an update of the source tree before every build or not.
.Pp
Default:
.Sq true .
.El
.Pp
The following variables configure the pkgsrc environment within the sandbox
(i.e. how the packages will be built):
.Bl -tag -width SANDBOX_CONFFILE
.It Va EXTRA_MKCONF
Absolute path to an optional file in the host that contains additional
.Xr mk.conf 5
contents to use for the build of packages within the sandbox.
You can use this to configure settings like
.Va ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES
or
.Va PKG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS .
.Pp
Default: not defined.
.It Va LOCALBASE
Absolute path to the directory where the packages will be installed.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa /usr/pkg .
.It Va NJOBS
Number of
.Xr make 1
jobs to use during the build of packages.
.Pp
Default: number of CPUs in the machine.
.It Va PKG_DBDIR
Absolute path to the directory where
.Xr pkg_add 8
et. al. will maintain the database of installed directories.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa /usr/pkg/libdata/pkgdb .
.It Va SYSCONFDIR
Absolute path to the directory in which to install managed configuration
files.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa /etc .
.It Va VARBASE
Absolute path to the directory that holds mutable data.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa /var .
.El
.Ss Hooks
Hooks are user-provided routines invoked at particular points during the
build process.
These are defined as shell functions and have access to the configuration
variables in the file.
Hooks must return a success error code and they cannot contain unprotected
shell commands.
In other words, they are run under a shell configured with
.Sq set -e .
.Pp
The following hooks can be defined:
.Bl -tag -width post_build_hookXX
.It Fn post_fetch_hook
Function executed right after all source trees have been updated by the
.Sq fetch
command.
