.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility to build pkgsrc packages in a fully automated and self-contained
manner.
The process is made unattended by relying on a configuration file that
prespecifies the location of all build components, the environment in which to
build the packages (aka the layout of the chroot sandbox), and the desired goals
of the build.
If you want to plug
.Nm
into
.Xr cron 8 ,
please take a look to
.Xr pkg_comp4cron 8
now.
.Pp
.Nm
can be seen as a wrapper over
.Xr cvs 1 ,
the pbulk infrastructure provided by pkgsrc, and
.Xr sandboxctl 8 .
.Nm
provides the following additional features:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Automatically fetch or update the pkgsrc tree before performing a build.
.It
Preconfigure the way binary packages are built (file system layout, package
options, etc.) by storing all relevant details in a configuration file.
.It
Preconfigure a clean environment (chroot sandbox) in which the packages are
built to avoid system-wide side-effects and contamination.
.It
Trivially set up periodic pkgsrc rebuilds by adding a single line to your
.Xr crontab 5 .
.El
.Pp
As you can see in the
.Sx SYNOPSIS
section,
.Nm
provides a subcommand-interface: the tool has several modes of operation,
and the particular mode to use for a given run is selected by the first
non-option argument in the command line.
.Pp
The following options apply to all commands:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Fl c Ar config_name
Specifies the configuration file to use.
The format of the file is described in
.Xr pkg_comp.conf 5 .
.Pp
If
.Ar config_name
includes any directory separator (aka, one or more slashes) or the
.Sq .conf
suffix, then this specifies the path of the configuration file to load.
.Pp
If
.Ar config_name
is a plain name without any directory components nor extension, then this
specifies the name of the configuration.
In this case,
.Nm
will use
.Pa __PKG_COMP_ETCDIR__/<config_name>.conf ,
which must exist; otherwise, the tool exits with an error.
.It Fl o Ar variable=value
Applies an override to the loaded configuration.
.Pp
The
.Ar variable
part of the argument must be any of the recognized configuration variables
described in
.Xr pkg_comp.conf 5 .
The
.Ar value ,
if not empty, specifies the value to set the configuration variable to.
If
.Ar value
is empty, then the configuration variable is unset.
.El
.Ss The auto command
The auto command provides the main functionality of
.Nm
as it orchestrates all other subcommands in an unattended manner.
This command allows you to trivially rebuild all the packages you are interested
in at will, even as a periodic
.Xr cron 8
job; see
.Xr pkg_comp4cron 8
if you are interested in doing this.
.Pp
The auto command performs the following steps:
.Bl -enum
.It
If
.Va UPDATE_SOURCES
is true, the fetch command is invoked first.
See
.Sx The fetch command
for more details.
.It
Creates the sandbox by invoking the sandbox-create command.
.It
Bootstraps pkgsrc and pbulk within the sandbox by invoking the bootstrap
command.
See
.Sx The bootstrap command
for more details.
.It
Builds the set of packages given either in the
.Va AUTO_PACKAGES
configuration variable or on the command line by passing those to the
build command.
See
.Sx The build command
for more details.
.It
Destroys the sandbox by invoking the sandbox-destroy command.
.El
.Pp
The following options apply only to the auto command:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Fl f
Enables fast mode, which skips updating the source tree.
This is a shorthand for these generic flags:
.Fl o Ar UPDATE_SOURCES=false .
.El
.Ss The bootstrap command
The bootstrap command prepares the pkgsrc infrastructure within the sandbox to
be ready to build packages.
This involves two steps:
.Bl -enum
.It
Bootstraps pkgsrc and installs pbulk under the sandboxes'
.Pa /pkg_comp/pbulk
tree.
This installation is used internally by
.Nm
thus is not configurable.
.It
Bootstraps pkgsrc in the location configured by the user via the
.Va LOCALBASE
et. al. configuration variables.
.El
.Pp
On completion, the packages directory configured by the
.Va PACKAGES
configuration variable will contain binary bootstrap kits for all built binaries
and packages.
.Pp
Any existing binaries within the
.Va PACKAGES
tree will be reused on subsequent bootstrap operations if found.
If you want to start builds afresh, you will have to remove the previous binary
packages.
.Ss The build command
The build command triggers the build of a set of packages within the
sandbox via pbulk.
The sandbox must have already been created with the sandbox-create command, but
it need not have been bootstrapped yet; create takes care of bootstrapping if
necessary.
.Pp
The packages to build can be provided either as bare names, such as
.Sq tmux ,
or as category/package pairs, such as
.Sq misc/tmux .
.Pp
On completion, the binary packages are left in the directory specified by the
.Va PACKAGES
configuration variable under a
.Pa pkg
subdirectory, which can later be fed to other tools such as
.Xr pkg_add 8
or
.Xr pkgin 8
to install the resulting binary packages.
.Pp
Note that, due to the way pbulk works, this command will build the packages
provided on the command line
.Em and all other packages previously built within the sandbox .
This is necessary to keep fully-populated
.Xr pkg_summary 5
databases.
However, because pbulk reuses existing binary packages and only rebuilds updated
packages, any packages not given on the command line should "build" quickly.
.Ss The config command
The config command dumps the loaded configuration to the standard output.
The format of the output is not a script, so it cannot be fed back into
.Nm .
The purpose of this command is to aid in debugging the configuration of the
tool before performing any builds, particularly when the configuration
files use shell logic to determine the value of any variables.
.Pp
The output contains two separate "paragraphs": the first lists all options
specific to
.Nm ,
including those given on the command line and in
.Xr pkg_comp.conf 5 ;
and the second lists all options passed to
.Xr sandboxctl 8
as specified in the configuration file pointed at by
.Va SANDBOX_CONFFILE .
.Ss The fetch command
The fetch command downloads or updates the pkgrsrc tree.
.Pp
If the module do not exist yet in the location specified by
.Va PKGSRCDIR ,
this performs an initial CVS checkout of the tree.
If the module exists, this performs a CVS update.
.Pp
The
.Va CVSROOT
and
.Va CVSTAG
variables are used to determine where to get the sources from and whether a
particular tag is desired.
.Ss Sandbox manipulation commands
The
.Sq sandbox-<command>
family of commands are simple wrappers around
.Xr sandboxctl 8
using the sandbox configuration specified in the
.Va SANDBOX_CONFFILE
configuration variable.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Pa __PKG_COMP_ETCDIR__/
Directory containing all system-wide configuration files.
.It Pa __PKG_COMP_ETCDIR__/default.conf
Default configuration file to load if the
.Fl c
flag is not provided.
.It Pa __PKG_COMP_ETCDIR__/extra.mk.conf
Sample contents for possible free-form
.Xr mk.conf 5
extensions.
This file is explicitly referenced from
.Pa default.conf
by the
.Va EXTRA_MKCONF
configuration variable.
.It Pa __PKG_COMP_ETCDIR__/sandbox.conf
Sample contents for the
.Xr sandboxctl 8
configuration file to use in the build of packages.
This file is explicitly referenced from
.Pa default.conf
by the
.Va SANDBOX_CONFFILE
configuration variable.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following examples assume that you have already configured
.Xr pkg_comp.conf 5
and its corresponding
.Xr sandbox.conf 5
file.
.Pp
To build a collection of packages from scratch, on a system in which you may not
yet have pkgsrc nor an existent sandbox:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pkg_comp auto bash emacs sudo tmux
.Ed
.Pp
To manually control the lifecycle of the sandbox, the updates to the pkgsrc
tree, and to build the same set of packages, you would do:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pkg_comp sandbox-create
# pkg_comp fetch
# pkg_comp build bash emacs sudo tmux
# pkg_comp sandbox-destroy
.Ed
.Pp
After the commands above, and under the default configuration, you will find
the resulting binary packages under
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc/packages/pkg/All .
All you need to do to use them via
.Xr pkg_add 8
is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# PKG_PATH=file:///usr/pkgsrc/packages/pkg/All; export PKG_PATH
# pkg_add sudo
.Ed

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
1.x first appeared in pkgsrc on September 6th, 2002 as the
.Pa pkgtools/pkg_comp
package and was later moved to
.Pa pkgtools/pkg_comp1
on February 12th, 2017, to make room for the 2.x series.
The old code was moved aside, instead of just being replaced, because the
1.x series are completely different to the 2.x series and the configuration
cannot be trivially migrated.
.Pp
.Nm
2.x, documented here, first appeared on TODO, 2017 as a full rewrite
of the original tool.
The rewrite had been in the works for years, seeing multiple iterations.
The first was sometime in 2006, when I attempted to rewrite
.Nm
in the language I had just learned: Haskell.
The second was sometime in 2010 or so, when I tried to rewrite the tool
in Python soon after I joined Google as an SRE.
The third, which is what you witness here together with the separate
.Xr sandboxctl 8
tool, started in 2013 but was put on hold pretty much until 2017 due to me
spending more time with family.
I was finally able to make the time to complete this rewrite by shifting my
schedule to start the day at 5am.
.Pp
The main reasons for the 2.x rewrite, which involve a complete departure from
the codebase of 1.x and its configuration interface, were the desire to make
.Nm
work across platforms, to integrate with pkgsrc's bootstrap and pbulk
technologies, and to make it testable to ensure its reliability.
.Pp
See
.Pa __PKG_COMP_DOCDIR__/NEWS
for more details on the changes across releases.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was developed by
.An Julio Merino
.Aq jmmv@google.com .
.Sh BUGS
The following are known limitations in the current
.Nm
implementation.
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Nm
unconditionally configures a pkgsrc bootstrap kit for the target location given
by the user in
.Va LOCALBASE .
This is intentional for simplicity and consistency across platforms but means
that the
.Xr pkg_add 8
family of tools and
.Xr make 1
provided by the base system are ignored.
.It
Even though pkgsrc supports unprivileged builds,
.Nm
currently requires root.
The reason is that
.Nm
relies on a sandbox created by
.Xr sandboxctl 8
to build packages, and entering a sandbox with
.Xr chroot 8
requires root privileges.
It would be nice to lift this restriction so that users could rebuild personal
sets of binary packages under their home directory.
One option would be to make the use of a sandbox optional, with the
understanding that not using a sandbox would leave any current set of installed
packages non-functional during the build.
.It
.Nm
currently only includes support for
.Xr cvs 1
to fetch the pkgsrc tree.
This mimics the official upstream distribution mechanism but poses a problem
when bootstrapping pkgsrc on, e.g. macOS.
Support for
.Xr git 1
will be added.
.It
The layout of the generated
.Va PACKAGES
tree currently conflates the two binary bootstrap kits and packages managed by
.Nm .
As a result, the tree contains two subdirectories, which is not what you would
expect from standard pkgsrc builds.
This will be fixed.
.It
.Nm
is the successor to
.Xr pkg_comp 8 ,
.Nm
but still lacks some interesting features from its parent.
