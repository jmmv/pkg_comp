Changes in version 2.1
======================

**STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT; NOT RELEASED YET.**

* Issue 10: Fixed generation of pkg_summary so that it includes all
  packages and not only those that were explicitly given to the `auto`
  or `build` commands after a clean rebuild of the sandbox.

* PR 20: Fixed the default Git repository from jsonn's to NetBSD's as
  it has moved upstream.


Changes in version 2.0
======================

**Released on 2017-02-17.**

This is the first release of the pkg_comp project as a standalone
package.  This new release shares no code with previous versions and is
not compatible with them.

The following are the major differences between pkg_comp 2.0 and all
previous releases, which incidentally are the reasons that triggered
this rewrite:

* Support for multiple platforms.

* Use of pbulk to (re)build packages within the sandbox.  This results
  in more reliable incremental builds after pkgsrc updates.

* Support for bootstrap, generating binary kits as part of the builds.

* Better scriptability to allow running from cron(8) trivially.


1.x versions
============

pkg_comp 1.x existed in pkgsrc from 2002-09-06 under the
pkgtools/pkg_comp subdirectory and was later moved to pkgtools/pkg_comp1
on 2017-02-12.

The history of those releases can be found in the pkgsrc repository,
but as the codebase was so different that the new code, I did not
bother to port the notes to this file.
